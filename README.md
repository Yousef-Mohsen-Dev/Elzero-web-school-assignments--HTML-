# Elzero Web School - HTML Assignments 🚀

This repository contains my personal solutions to all assignments from the **Elzero Web School HTML course**. It marks my journey of revisiting and mastering the fundamentals of web development.

After completing an advanced track in the Digital Egypt Pioneers initiative, I took a step back to rebuild my core skills from the ground up. This project is a testament to that journey, showcasing my dedication to creating a solid foundation in front-end development.
